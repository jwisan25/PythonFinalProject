I wanted to find if there was a connection between differnt things like if cholestorol and age were connected. Diving into this showed me which factors are linked and could help predict heart problems. I also looked at key numbers like cholesterol, heart rate, and blood pressure to see how they vary. It also helped me find common values like the average and median for these health stats.

For data manipulations, I sorted the age in descending order so the oldest people were at the top. I didn't really remove outliers because they were just normal outliers which had relevance to the data. The  dataset was grouped by sex so I could compare characteristics like cholesterol levels, resting blood pressure, and heart rate trends across genders in the filtered, high-risk population.
